                    Apparently you are using a browser that does not support the
                    FileSystem API, which is necessary for Cardenal Lite Web to work...
                    But do not worry! We also have a version of Cardenal Lite for
                    desktop called <a target="_blank" class="info-url" href="https://github.com/Root404EngineeringTeam/Cardenal-Lite-Desktop">Cardenal Lite Desktop</a>; It's free and faster than Cardenal Lite Web!
                    <br><br>
                    We are also working on a version of Cardenal Lite for smartphones.
                    Cardenal Lite Mobile coming soon!

                <h4>What is this?</h4>
                <p>
                    Cardenal Lite&trade; is a free and open source tool
                    to encrypt your personal files in order to keep them
                    safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You only will need a secret password to protect your files.
                    We won't save that password. Once the file has been protected only you will have access to unlock your files.
                    <b>Be careful! if you lose your password you won't be able to
                    recover your files.</b>
                </p>
                <h4>How it works?</h4>
                <p>
                    We use a simple but efficient and secure encryption algorithm based on bitwise XOR logical operations. You can encrypt up than 10GB of data per file.
                </p>
