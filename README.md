# Cardenal Lite™

### What is this?

Cardenal Lite™ is a free and open source tool to encrypt your personal files in order to keep them safe.

You only will need a secret password to protect your files. We won't save that password. Once the file has been protected only you will have access to unlock your files. Be careful! if you lose your password you won't be able to recover your files.

### How it works?

We use a simple but efficient and secure encryption algorithm based on bitwise XOR logical operations. You can encrypt up than 10GB of data per file.
